# Github Guideline

## Make sure you have all the information.

* LOGO IMAGE
* JSON FILE
>  NOTE: Please ensure to use UTF-8 encoding in the json file to avoid Travis-CI build error. Please check the template file to fill in the complete information: [token-template](./tokens/$template.json)  [gateway-template](./gateways/$template.json)  [operator-template](./operators/$template.json)

Make sure all the files were under the directory with the format-required name on your own operating system.

`token`
``` 
    ../btc/

```
`gateway`
```

    vite-labs.json
    vite-labs.png
```
`operator`
``` 
    ../vite_050697d3810c30816b005a03511c734c1159f50907662b046f/

    vite_050697d3810c30816b005a03511c734c1159f50907662b046f.json
